# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
This repository hosts the artifacts from the CS-230 Operating Platforms course.

## Response
The client The Gaming Room required a sotfware design for their Draw It or Lose It application, in which they desired to effectively reach multiple platforms with a proven architecture and efficient development process. The design document effectively speaks to the requirements of a client-server model being maintained on a cloud-hosted Linux operating platform, that sufficiently meets the client requirements and provides insights on the benefits and resources needed to maintain this architecture. Maintaining this document provides a clear and concise direction to inform further decisions made, and will provide a reference that will ease development efforts as a pattern is established and communicated. The sections which may require revision are the final sections, which may be refined to best communicate additional needs as they are identified during development. This document provides an efficient and clear communication of the design which speaks directly to the clients needs, and maximizes developer resources. Additionally, this design could be used across future applications, and could be modified to meet needs of similar softwares.

This course was an excellent experience and this design document speaks to the quality of the content and instruction.
